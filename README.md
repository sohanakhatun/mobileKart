This repository contains the backend part of the code for the Application MobileKart- a mobile Ordering application.
The backend uses NodeJS and ExpressJs for the APIs and for storing the data I have used Json mock data.
data.json file contains the data of the products or mobiles that are available on the platform.
users.json file contains the mock data of the users, I have used NodeJS to read and update the file.
